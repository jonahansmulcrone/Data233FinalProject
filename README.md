Project Overview:
The aim is to develop an application that analyzes Yelp restaurant reviews for various locations and offers recommendations based on the weather conditions of a specified day. 
This project will not only extract insights from Yelp reviews but also enhance the decision-making process for users by considering the weather as a factor in restaurant selection.

Data Collection (10 points)
Yelp Reviews: Use the Yelp API to collect data on restaurants, including reviews, ratings, location, and categories. Focus on gathering a diverse set of data that covers multiple types of dining experiences and cuisines.
Weather Data: Utilize a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to get current or forecasted weather conditions for the targeted locations.

Data Analysis on Yelp Reviews (20 points)
NLP Analysis: Apply natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of Yelp reviews. Identify key themes, positive and negative feedback, and overall customer satisfaction.
Review Patterns: Investigate any patterns that emerge from the reviews, such as the impact of location, cuisine type, or time of day on the ratings and sentiments.

Weather-Based Recommendation System (30 points)
Integration: Incorporate weather data to create a context-aware recommendation system. For example, suggest cozy, indoor restaurants during cold weather and outdoor dining options for warmer conditions.
Prediction and Analysis: Develop a model that predicts the popularity or recommendation score of a restaurant based on its reviews and the current weather conditions. Assess the model's performance on a
testing dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability (You may need to explore several models, if the group size is 3, then at least 3 models for comparison).

Visualization (20 points)
Create visualizations to illustrate:
Sentiment analysis results and rating distributions of Yelp reviews.
The relationship between weather conditions and restaurant recommendations.
Any other insightful findings from the Yelp review analysis.

Presentation (20 points)
Present your project findings, including the methodology for collecting and analyzing Yelp reviews, integrating weather data, and how these elements were used to make restaurant recommendations.
Discuss the design and accuracy of your prediction model, highlighting any comparisons with alternative models if conducted. Reflect on the project's challenges, enjoyable aspects, and the lessons learned by each group member.
Please submit PPT slides and the report of the project in the form of Jupyter-notebook
